#Concise
This project is where I learn to read and show pictures using Python and the OpenCV library.

#Slightly More Detail:
This code uses the OpenCV library in Python to perform simple tasks: loading an image, showing it on the screen, and saving it.

#Focusing on the Purpose:
This is the basic setup for any project that needs to look at or change images using Python and a tool called OpenCV.
